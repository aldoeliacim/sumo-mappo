# ðŸš¦ SUMO-MAPPO â€” Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Unsignalized Intersections

> **Central idea:** learn a **joint-action PPO (MAPPO-style)** policy that lets multiple vehicles cross a four-way **unsignalized** intersection safely and efficientlyâ€”outperforming a rule-based four-way-stop baseline.

## âœ¨ Key Features
* **Reproducible SUMO â‡„ Gym bridge** â€“ custom environment with TraCI, ready for SB3.
* **Centralised training** with a single policy outputting joint actions for all approaches.
* **Rule-based baseline** (first-come-first-served) for quick benchmarking.
* **Modular reward**: collisions, delay, throughput â€“ easy to re-weight or extend to explicit multi-objective RL.
